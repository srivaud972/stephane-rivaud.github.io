<p>
    I am currently doing a post-doc at ISIR in the MLIA team for the ADONIS[webpage href] project. <br>
    Prior to that, I was a doing a PhD in collaboration with Sony CSL Paris and Univeristy of Reims Champagne Ardennes.<br>
    I have a mathematical background and a specialization in Machine Learning for music production. <br>
    My research interest in Machine Learning are the understanding of reasoning, statistical inference, computational complexity and dee learning. <br>
    My detailed CV can be found somewhere. <br>
